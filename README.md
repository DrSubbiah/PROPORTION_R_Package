## Overview  
Extensive statistical practice has shown the importance and relevance of the inferential problem of estimating probability parameters in a binomial experiment; especially on the issues of competing intervals from frequentist, Bayesian, and Bootstrap approaches. The package `proportion` tries to take care of the issues, by pooling a number (50+) of widely available and well-performing methods and essential variations. A wide range of functions (300+) helps users with differing skills to estimate, evaluate, summarize, numerically and graphically, various measures adopting either the frequentist or the Bayesian paradigm.

It builds on the work “*A comprehensive R package for inference on a single Binomial proportion and Bayesian computations*” (DOI: 10.1016/j.softx.2017.01.001).  \

## Installation  
You can install the package directly from GitHub using:

```r
install.packages(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrSubbiah/PROPORTION_R_Package/main/dist/proportion_2.0.2.tar.gz",
  repos = NULL,
  type = "source"
)
````

## Usage

Once installed, load the package:

```r
library(proportion)
```

Then call any of the available functions for interval estimation, summaries or plotting. *(Detailed examples will be provided in the package vignettes or documentation.)*
